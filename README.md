# TimeChimp React Coding Challenge 🎧

## Setup 🚀

- Fork this repo
- Install all dependencies using `npm install`
- Run the app using `npm start`

## Assessment 📖

Use the Spotify API to fetch and display the following items:

- Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*

## Think about 💡

- Taking a look at the Spotify API documentation
- Do you resolve each API request one after the other or in parallel?
- Where do you make the API requests?
- Do you implement state management using something like Redux?
- How much logic do you offload out of the UI components?

We don't want to restrict you too much so feel free to scope the project to your time and needs.
However; make sure there is enough code (written by yourself) to explain your design and approach.

*Be creative, be awesome!*
